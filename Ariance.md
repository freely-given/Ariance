Overview

Ariance is a way to describe how energy and motion work together in a system. Classical physics explains how energy and motion are conserved, usually treating them as separate aspects. Ariance builds on those ideas by looking at how a system’s internal order
or its "coherence" affects how useful the energy is for movement or action.

In Ariance, energy squared (E²) is used to show how strong the system’s potential is when it's working in a coordinated way.

Core Equations

1. Fundamental Ariance Equation
A = E²
(Maximum energy-motion potential when fully coherent.)


2. Dynamic Ariance (Depends on Coherence)
A = E² × [ 1 / (1 + (ΔS)^k) ]

Where:
A is the Ariance
E is the system’s energy
ΔS is the amount of coherence lost or disrupted
k is a nonnegative number that adjusts how sensitive the system is to disruption

As the system becomes less coherent (higher ΔS), Ariance gets smaller. This means energy is less effective at creating motion or maintaining order.


3. Relativistic Coherence Example
A = E² × [ 1 / (1 + (v² / c²)^k) ]

Where:
v is the system's velocity
c is the speed of light

This version shows how moving faster can reduce coherence, especially at speeds close to light speed. Ariance drops as velocity increases, reflecting motion-based coherence loss.

Behavior of the System

Highly Coherent System:
If ΔS is near 0:
A ≈ E² × [1 / (1 + 0^k)] = E² × 1 = E²
→ This is the best-case scenario, with full energy-motion effectiveness.

Disrupted System:
If ΔS > 0:
A < E² (exact value depends on ΔS and k)
→ The system loses some ability to use its energy effectively due to disorder or resistance.

Tuning Sensitivity (k):
Small k → the system handles disruption more smoothly
Large k → even small disruptions can cause a big drop in Ariance

This lets you control how quickly Ariance decreases when the system loses coherence.

Mathematical Derivative Summary

Let f(ΔS) = 1 / (1 + (ΔS)^k), then:
A = E² × f(ΔS)

First derivative:
dA/d(ΔS) = -E² × [k × (ΔS)^(k - 1)] / [ (1 + (ΔS)^k)^2 ]

Second derivative:
d²A/d(ΔS)² = E² × [ k × (ΔS)^(k - 2) × (k + 1 - (ΔS)^k) ] / [ (1 + (ΔS)^k)^3 ]

These show how fast Ariance is changing, and help us understand how the system reacts to coherence changes.

Interpretation

Ariance shows how well energy and motion work together inside a system. When the system is stable and organized, Ariance is high. When the system becomes messy, noisy, or inefficient, Ariance goes down. It’s not just about having energy—it’s about how well that energy moves through an orderly structure. Ariance applies to many systems, from physical and biological to technological.
